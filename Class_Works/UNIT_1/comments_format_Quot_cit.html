  <h3>THEVINS THEOREM</h3>
  <p>According to <pre><b>Thevenin's theorem</b></pre>Any two output terminals active linear network containing independent sources(<i>includes voltage and current sources</i>) can be replaced by <u>Thevenins equivalent</u> circuit<i>(which contains voltage of V<sub>TH</sub> in series with resisitor R<sub>TH</sub></i>).</p>

  <h3>NORTON'S THEOREM</h3>
  <p>According to <pre><b>Norton's theorem</b></pre>Any two output terminals active linear network containing independent sources(<i>includes voltage and current sources</i>) can be replaced by <u>Norton's equivalent</u> circuit<i>(which contains current source of I<sub>N</sub> in parallel with resisitor R<sub>N</sub></i>).</p>

<p>Move Like Everything is gonna work out.Brcause it is.
  <blockqoute>Youe mindset is the engine.Your faith is fuel.Stop second gussing and satrt showing up like it's already done.Speak it.Walk it.Own it.doubt has no place in a vision this big.When you move with belief,the universe responds.Doors open.Opportunities appear.The right people align.You have survived too much to play it small now .Trust your pace.and most of all, trust that everything you are building is going to pay off.keep going.keep ginding.</blockqoute>
